Key Improvements and Considerations:

Two-Column Layout: Improves visual organization and makes it easier to compare ""From"" and ""To"" budget items.
Real-Time Balance Display: Showing the available balance prominently prevents errors.
Real-Time Validation: Validating the transfer amount as the user types improves the user experience.
Clear Labels: Using precise and descriptive labels enhances clarity.
Searchable Dropdowns: Using searchable dropdowns with auto-complete makes it faster to find budget items.
Character Count: Adding a character count to the ""Reason"" field helps users stay within any character limits.
Visual Feedback:
Provide immediate feedback when a budget item is selected.
Display error messages clearly if validation fails.
Display a success message after a transfer is submitted.
Confirmation Modal:
Before submitting the transfer, display a confirmation modal summarizing the transfer details.
This prevents accidental transfers.
Accessibility:
Ensure the screen is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility).
User Flow:

Select ""From"" Budget Item: The available balance is displayed.
Select ""To"" Budget Item: The current approved amount is displayed.
Enter Transfer Amount: Real-time validation occurs.
Select Transfer Date:
Enter Reason:
